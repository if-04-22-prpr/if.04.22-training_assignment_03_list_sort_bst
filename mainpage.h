* -# make cleantest: This new make target for clearing the console, building, and running unit test is available.
* -# Sometimes changes are not properly detected by incremental builds. If something very strange 
*    happens during compilation, try to run `make clean` followed by `make` to start a clean build.
*    This approach is also recommended after everthing is done, because some compiler warning appears
*    only in clean builds.
